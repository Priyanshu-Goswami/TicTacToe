# Tic Tac Toe Game with ReactJS

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using ReactJS. It's created as a practice project to familiarize oneself with ReactJS concepts such as components, state management, and event handling.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: The game board consists of a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns to mark their respective symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.

2. **Objective**: The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

3. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns to place their symbol on the grid by clicking on an empty cell.

4. **Winning the Game**: The game ends when one player successfully gets three of their symbols in a row, or if the grid is full with no winner, resulting in a draw.
